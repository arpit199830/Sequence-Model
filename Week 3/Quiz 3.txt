1. False

2. Beam search will run more slowly.

   Beam search will use up more memory.

   Beam search will generally find better solutions (i.e. do a better job maximizing P(y \mid x)P(y∣x))

3. True
 
4. No, because P(y∗∣x)≤P(y^∣x) indicates the error should be attributed to the RNN rather than to the search algorithm.

5. True

6. We expect α<t,t’> to be generally larger for values of a<t’> that are highly relevant to the value the network should output for y<t>. (Note the indices in the superscripts.)

   ∑t’ α<t,t’> =1 (Note the summation is over t’t’.)

7. True 

8. The input sequence length Tx is large.

9. cookbook

10. Features of the audio( such as spectrogram features) at time t.
